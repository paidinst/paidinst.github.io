## Course Description

Living Latin in Rome is an intensive Latin experience set in the city of Rome. In two seminar-style meetings every day, participants read and discuss Latin literature and Roman history and culture. To the extent possible, the language of instruction in these seminars is Latin. 

In addition to the daily seminar sessions, the program includes a variety of optional programming designed to build students’ facility in speaking and understanding Latin, as well as lectures on topics relating to Roman history and culture, and visits to historical sites in Rome. The program also features a trip to an important site outside of Rome that is relevant to the program’s theme. 

In 2022, Living Latin in Rome will focus on the poetry of Catullus and visit Verona and the Sirmio Peninsula, where Catullus had his summer villa.

## Prerequisites 

Participants should know the basics of Latin grammar. This usually means the equivalent of one year of college or two years of high-school Latin. No experience speaking Latin is required, but experienced Latin speakers are also encouraged to apply. Paideia alumni and Nexus members are particularly encouraged to apply.

Participants must be 18 years or older. Students under the age of 18 should consider Living Latin in Rome High School.

## Classroom

Classes for Living Latin in Rome take place in classrooms at the Teresianum, a pontifical university in the Monteverde Vecchio neighborhood of Rome.
