The Paideia Institute for Humanistic Study, Inc. is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to promoting the study and appreciation of the classical humanities, with a focus on Latin and Ancient Greek languages and literature.

The Institute was founded in 2010 by former students of the Vatican Latinist Fr. Reginald Foster, who taught generations of Latin students to love the Latin language and the city of Rome.  Paideia’s goal at its foundation was to continue the tradition of Fr. Foster’s beloved course. 

Living Latin in Rome, Paideia’s flagship program, continues to provide the magical experience of learning to speak Latin amidst Rome’s ruins to today's students of Classics.

Since its foundation, Paideia has added several other independent programs including a Living Latin in Rome program for high school students, Living Greek in Greece, Living Latin in Paris and Caesar in Gaul, and a fellowship for a year of postgraduate study in Rome. Paideia also works with high schools and universities to enhance their offerings in classics in the U.S. and to help them develop study-abroad experiences in Greece, Italy and elsewhere in Western Europe.

In addition to programming abroad, the Paideia Institute operates online classes through TelePaideia, holds domestic events and conferences for students and teachers of Latin and Greek, and runs outreach initiatives and publications that increase access to and engagement with the classical humanities outside of academia.

## Our Mission

The Paideia Institute promotes the study of the classical humanities through academic programming abroad, US-based outreach, publications, and digital initiatives.

Paideia's programs and initiatives reach individuals of all ages and academic levels and are unified by three goals: to provide opportunities for rigorous and intensive study of Latin and Greek from all historical periods, to inspire students to form close personal relationships with the classics through extraordinary learning experiences, and to increase access to and engagement with the classical humanities across all sectors of society.
