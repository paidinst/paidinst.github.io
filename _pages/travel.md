## LIVING LATIN IN ROME HIGH SCHOOL

Living Latin in Rome High School offers a holistic immersion experience in the Latin language and the city of Rome that is specifically designed for high school students. The program brings Latin to life both by reading ancient texts at the historical sites where they happened and through a variety of student-centered approaches spanning both traditional and spoken Latin methodologies. Readings are drawn from the entire history of the Latin language and therefore include medieval and Renaissance Latin, to which students are rarely exposed in typical high school curricula.

The program lasts for two weeks in July. It includes traditional classroom sessions, informal conversational Latin sessions, interactive visits to important historical and literary sites in Rome, the production of a Latin skit to be performed in an assembly of fellow students and friends of the Paideia Institute, and day trips to important sites outside of Rome.

## LIVING GREEK IN GREECE HIGH SCHOOL

Living Greek in Greece High School offers an introduction to the Ancient Greek language in the rich cultural setting of modern Greece that is specifically designed for high school students. The program accommodates a range of language backgrounds: we welcome beginner participants who have not even learned the Greek alphabet, but we also offer linguistic enrichment for students who have had the equivalent of a year or more of college Greek. Students will encounter Ancient Greek texts from a wide range of times, places, and intellectual traditions, including the works of Homer, Plato, the New Testament, and the Byzantines.

Learning Ancient Greek can also help us understand and connect with other modern cultures, especially with Greeks today. For that reason, this program is committed to balancing time spent engaging with Ancient Greek language and exploring its continuing role in modern Greek food, music, and dance.

The program lasts for two weeks in July. It includes traditional classroom sessions, informal conversational Greek sessions, and interactive visits to many places and sites of ancient and modern significance: Athens, Corinth, Nafplio, Epidaurus, Olympia, and Delphi.
