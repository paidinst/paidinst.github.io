Do you want to review a book, movie, or exhibition with a Classical theme? Is there something going on in your classroom or city that the wider Classics community should know about? Do you have a thoughtful, funny, or otherwise interesting essay about Classics and culture which needs a venue? Pitch it to us at inmediasres@paideia-institute.org. Weâ€™re looking for interesting writing about Classical things.
